// src/effects/table.mjs — THE effects ledger (m42 wave (d) leg d2; PRD-command-spine-
// effects-ledger). One executable table owning every consequence and its
// topology: EFFECTS maps each domain event to its reactors, each tagged with the
// LOCUS of the one store it mutates. This file is the executable replacement for
// the prose coupling registry ("the scan ORCHESTRATES, work.mjs WRITES", "MUST
// NEVER touch", …): adding a consequence is one line HERE, never a re-remembered
// call-site copy. Rule three of TECH_DEBT item 0: one home per fact, one door
// per act, ONE LEDGER PER CONSEQUENCE.
//
// Reactor contract (dispatch enforces the discipline, this file declares it):
//   - `apply(event)` where event = { eventId, name, payload } — the payload is
//     the event's own evidence (never an empty ping that forces a racing
//     re-read); a reactor rebuilds everything it needs from it.
//   - IDEMPOTENT or event-id-deduped: delivery is at-least-once by design
//     (crash between write and drain, redelivery over the bridge in d3).
//   - Mutates exactly ONE store — the one its locus names.
//
// Loci (where the mutated store's one writer can run):
//   checkout            — the repo folder holding the item (frontmatter, runs/)
//   control-store       — the authoritative mesh SQLite (d3 wires its reactors)
//   local               — this node's own projection/logs
//   integration:<name>  — an external system + credentials (d4 wires Notion)

// not in-progress / no record doc) is the sanctioned no-op, exactly the inline
