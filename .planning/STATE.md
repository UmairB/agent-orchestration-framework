# State: AOF

**Initialized:** 2026-05-06
**Current phase:** Planning next milestone
**Status:** v1 milestone archived and ready for next milestone definition

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-05-07 after v1 milestone)

**Core value:** Users can configure assistant skills, commands, agents, rules/instructions, and GSD framework setup once in `.aof/`, then reliably generate the correct Claude Code and Codex files without hand-maintaining assistant-specific folders.

## Roadmap Reference

See: `.planning/ROADMAP.md`

## Milestone Reference

See: `.planning/MILESTONES.md`

## Current Focus

v1 is shipped and archived. Current focus is defining the next milestone scope and fresh requirements.

## Resume

**Stopped at:** v1 milestone archived
**Resume file:** `.planning/MILESTONES.md`

## Memory

- Existing codebase map is available in `.planning/codebase/`.
- GSD researcher and roadmapper subagent types were not installed in this runtime, so initialization research and roadmap creation were performed inline.
- User selected YOLO mode, standard granularity, parallel execution, git-tracked docs, research enabled, plan check enabled, verifier enabled, and balanced model profile.
- UI v1 is intentionally config editing only; CLI remains responsible for execution.
- Phase 1 context is captured in `.planning/phases/01-aof-workspace-model/01-CONTEXT.md`.
- Phase 1 planning produced 3 plans in `.planning/phases/01-aof-workspace-model/`.
- Phase 1 execution completed and passed verification in `.planning/phases/01-aof-workspace-model/01-VERIFICATION.md`.
- Global decision: BDD tests are required for all new functionality.
- Phase 2 context is captured in `.planning/phases/02-runtime-rendering-and-lock-state/02-CONTEXT.md`.
- Phase 2 research is captured in `.planning/phases/02-runtime-rendering-and-lock-state/02-RESEARCH.md`.
- Phase 2 planning produced 3 plans in `.planning/phases/02-runtime-rendering-and-lock-state/`.
- Phase 2 execution completed and passed verification in `.planning/phases/02-runtime-rendering-and-lock-state/02-VERIFICATION.md`.
- Phase 3 context is captured in `.planning/phases/03-cli-and-gsd-framework-flow/03-CONTEXT.md`.
- Phase 3 research is captured in `.planning/phases/03-cli-and-gsd-framework-flow/03-RESEARCH.md`.

- Phase 5 context is captured in `.planning/phases/05-verification-and-hardening/05-CONTEXT.md`.
- Phase 5 research is captured in `.planning/phases/05-verification-and-hardening/05-RESEARCH.md`.
- Phase 5 planning produced 3 plans in `.planning/phases/05-verification-and-hardening/`.
- Phase 5 execution completed and passed verification in `.planning/phases/05-verification-and-hardening/05-VERIFICATION.md`.
- Milestone v1 audit is archived in `.planning/milestones/v1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`; it finds no critical product gaps.
- Milestone v1 roadmap and requirements are archived in `.planning/milestones/`; live roadmap is collapsed for constant-size planning context.
